  Originally starting development in 2013, BossShopPro is a Minecraft plugin
  written in Java. It can be downloaded and used by server administrators, who
  can use the software on their server, resulting in an improved experience for
  their players.
</p>
<p>
  BossShop(Pro) was originally
  <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/bossshop">published on Bukkit</a>,
  where it was downloaded over 500.000 times. It has since been improved and
  updated a lot and is currently being
  <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/222">distributed via Spigot</a>.
  The source code of the plugin is
  <a href="https://github.com/Blackixx/BossShopPro">available on Github</a>,
  where other software developers have also made some contributions or even
  developed custom tooling for the plugin.

<p>
  Running my own Minecraft server in the past, I always thought about how to
  keep players motivated and allow players that are most active or bring
  leadership qualities to get some benefit. Therefore, I introduced different
  ranks, which players could achieve (e.g. Player, Builder, Moderator, Admin).
  While I assigned those ranks to the players manually, in the beginning, I
  quickly realized that I can not always be online and not watch every playe.
  Therefore, I wanted a system that allows players to increase their rank
  themselves if they meet certain conditions. Players would not be able to
  become administrators without my approval, but they would be able to get a few
  neat perks by being active. To make this possible, I wrote the Java plugin
  <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/commandrank-permissionsbukkit"
    >CommandRank</a
  >, one of my very first pieces of software. The plugin allows players to
  promote themselves via command IF they meet the given conditions.
</p>
<p>
  Next, I wanted to add some level of automation to the promotions to the
  Moderator ranks as well. I wanted to be able to keep track of the quantity and
  quality of the useful things the players did, who in turn could promote
  themselves to a certain Staff rank if they did enough of those useful things.
  Therefore, I invented and developed the plugin
  <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/playerpoints">PlayerPoints</a>, which
  introduces a second currency on the server (Points). At that time, on my
  server, I could give my players points if they did support me with server
  maintenance tasks or just building something nice for the server. The players
  could then use those points to promote themselves, via the plugin CommandRank,
  which can connect itself with PlayerPoints. This was the main purpose of
  PlayerPoints at that time. The resource has more than 120.000 Downloads now
  and is used for many other purposes besides just promotions. Many different
  plugins by other authors hook into PlayerPoints and use its API. I have handed
  over the maintenance of PlayerPoints to another developer, who has taken great
  care of the resource and improved the code quality a lot (at the time I wrote
  PlayerPoints, I was a complete beginner in Software Development). The code is
  available on Github too (<a href="https://github.com/Mitsugaru/PlayerPoints"
    >Link</a
  >).
</p>
<p>
  Having introduced a second currency (Points), I quickly came to the conclusion
  that it makes sense players can also buy other stuff from it, rather than just
  ranks. Therefore, I wrote the plugin
  <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/pointshop">PointShop</a>, which
  allows players to buy stuff for points. This plugin was one of the firsts of
  its kind: players could not just buy items with their currency, but also
  permissions or the execution of commands (e.g. a command of another plugin,
  that does something specific, like granting you a protected area to build). As
  people seemed to love the concept of buying different stuff (and not just
  items) via their currency, I wrote another plugin named
  <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/itemshop">ItemShop</a>, having the
  same features, but using Items as currency, instead of points. The code was
  mostly just copied from PointShop.
</p>
<p>
  While I had, originally, shied away from writing a shop plugin using the
  regular money currency, as many money shop plugins already existed, I finally
  decided, to port my unique shop plugin concept to a new plugin using the
  regular money currency.
  <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/moneyshop">MoneyShop</a> was born and
  it quickly became the most popular of the three plugins.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe you have noticed already: Now I had three almost identical plugins, with
  only the type of currency/cost differing. Maintaining those three (almost
  identical) codebases resulted in unnecessary effort. Therefore, I merged all
  of those three plugins into one new plugin:
  <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/bossshop">BossShop</a>. This plugin
  does not only allow server owners to create awesome shops, where they can
  define the price type of a shop entry (Money / Points / Items / and more!) and
  the reward type of that shop entry (Money / Points / Items / Permissions /
  Execution of commands / and many more!), but it also featured a nice graphical
  user interface, instead of requiring the players to use commands to buy
  things. It is a really sophisticated and big plugin and I am proud of what it
  is and what it has achieved. Fun Fact: the Chinese company NetEase has
  purchased a license, allowing them to distribute BossShop within the mainland
  of China.

  After maintaining BossShop for some time, some server owners and hardcore
  users of the plugin (mainly the owners from Snapcraft) were interested in even
  more features, such as conditions (e.g. some menu entries are available only
  when players have a certain rank or meet other conditions) and more. They
  proposed that I could create a premium version of BossShop, which I could then
  sell on the <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/">Spigot</a> marketplace, a
  website where many plugins already have been sold for money. This way I could
  afford to spend time on those advanced features. With those server owners as
  active testers of my new features, providing valuable input to what users of
  the plugin actually want, I started creating a premium version of the plugin,
  called BossShopPro. Not only did they provide valuable input in terms of
  ideas, but also in terms of graphics for the
  <a
    href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bossshoppro-the-most-powerful-chest-gui-shop-menu-plugin.222/"
    >BossShopPro resource page</a
  >
  and wiki page. BossShopPro quickly became a success. Just to show some of the
  reviews:

<p>
  Everything was great and I kept maintaining BossShopPro, until, at one point,
  I was about to graduate and start my first full-time job, which would be in
  the area of self-driving cars. This was the point, where I decided that I no
  longer have the capacity and time to work as a &quot;freelancer&quot; and sell
  software in my free time, let alone maintain projects of that size. Therefore,
  I turned BossShopPro into a free resource and turned it open source, allowing
  for external developers to contribute and continue it. The resource is now
  being continued <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/104824/">here</a>.
