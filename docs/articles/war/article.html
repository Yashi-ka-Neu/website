<p>
  War (also known as NeubyWar and later ZeubyWar) was a minigame for the
  computer game Minecraft, which I invented and developed (implemented as a Java
  plugin). The War plugin expanded the traditional gameplay of Minecraft by a
  <em>matchmaking</em> system (players can join a game lobby, get assigned to
  one of two teams, can vote for one of three randomly chosen maps, and when the
  countdown is over, finally get teleported to the battlefield), by a custom
  <em>currency</em> (money can be earned by damaging and killing enemies, as
  well as winning a match) and <em>custom weapons</em> and items with special
  effects (can be purchased with the money. Examples are grenades, sniper shot,
  mines, blindness bomb, machine gun, etc.).
</p>

<br />

<p>
  It was the very first Minecraft minigame I developed and was very fun to play,
  but was not optimized for a broad range of average players and instead rather
  difficult to understand and get into as a beginner. I learned a lot about
  software development during the creation of this Minigame and I also learned a
  lot about user experience and accessibility.

<h2>History</h2>

<br />

<h3>First steps</h3>

<br />

<p>
  Running my own Minecraft server in 2012, we had a core player base of around
  50 players, 5-20 being online simultaneously. Just wanting to have fun, we
  played and fought battles and so on, just as other regular players. One idea I
  had was, that we could divide us players (everyone who was interested) into
  two teams. Then, both teams would get a few days of time to build their
  castles, walls, and other combat buildings (e.g. hidden underground tunnels,
  etc.). Finally, everyone would get the same armor and weapons and we would
  fight. This was a lot of fun for us but it was quite some effort for me to
  coordinate everything, give everyone proper equipment, teleport the players to
  the corresponding locations, and so on. Therefore, after just one or two days
  after trying this "team blue vs team red" fight approach, I decided to write a
  (very) simple plugin that would automate that task.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Players could join the "battle" using one simple command and would
  automatically get assigned to a team, equipped with items, and teleported to
  the waiting area. After some time of no new player joining (or some fixed
  total countdown), players could start the fight with another simple command,
  causing the team members to get teleported to their team spawn and the battle
  officially starting. Every team would have a fixed number of "team lifes" and
  team members would be respawned after being killed until the team would have
  lost all of its lives. This was very simple, but also efficient and it did
  work.
</p>

<h3>Getting more sophisticated</h3>

<br />

<p>
  As the minigame was so much fun, I decided to invest more time into it and
  built a big "battlefield" map just for the minigame, making sure it was
  balanced and close to symmetric, as well as both teams having their
  recognizable bases and the map containing different tactical elements, such as
  underground tunnels, a high tree from which you could see the whole
  battlefield and use long-range attacks, and many more. I also introduced a new
  currency, which players would get awarded by damaging opponents and being good
  in the game. This currency could be used to buy so-called special attacks.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  In the beginning, I implemented just a hand-full of those special attacks: one
  attack that would shoot 10 arrows at once ("Superschuss", shoots them straight
  forward), one very expensive attack, that would launch many arrows around you
  in every direction ("Rundumschuss") and a few others. They would keep players
  engaged and it would feel just very satisfying to purchase and use one of
  those special attacks. The special attacks themselves were programmed by using
  the API of the Minecraft server: the "PlayerClickEvent" could be used to
  detect when a player uses right-click on a certain item, and then I would
  generate new arrow objects, spawn them and assign proper velocities to them,
  to achieve the intended effect of the attacks. By using this API and
  manipulating objects in the game many more special attacks were implemented by
  me during the development of the minigame.

<h3>More Maps</h3>

<br />

<p>
  I added code that made the minigame support multiple maps. As a server
  administrator, one could simply add a new map to the game with a simple
  command and defining the team spawn locations, as well as a few other map
  properties. Before a game would start, three of the maps would randomly be
  chosen and the players could vote for them. The map with the most votes
  (obviously) would get chosen.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Other players (especially server staff members) then started building their
  own "War" maps, which I added to the minigame. It was fun for everyone
  involved.

<br />

<h3>Custom Mod</h3>

<br />

<p>
  One pain point of the minigame was the special attack shops: players had to
  type a command to buy special attacks (e.g. "k buy superschuss"). Also,
  players had to look up the names of the special attacks using another command.
  This was not very intuitive and took time.
</p>

<p>
  To improve the situation, I wrote a custom Mod for the game Minecraft, which
  would add a graphical user interface for the player, where a player could
  browse through the different shop items (mainly attacks) and click a button to
  buy the corresponding item.
</p>

<p>
  This step improved the player experience for everyone having the mod; however,
  as the mod had to be manually downloaded and installed by the player, many
  players simply did not do this, so it did not significantly increase the
  accessibility of the game. Too bad I had not written the plugin BossShop(Pro)
  at this point.

<h3>Custom Texturepack</h3>

<br />

<p>
  One of my players was nice enough to create a custom "Texturepack" for the
  game, making the weapons look like actual weapons. Before, players would, for
  example, hold a stick and when performing a right-click, the stick would be
  consumed and arrows were spawned, simulating the effects of a machine gun. The
  texturepack made the stick look like an actual machine gun.

<h3>The End</h3>

<br />

<p>
  The minigame was a lot of fun for everyone involved, and I learned a lot
  through its development. Working with the game was such a creative time, and
  it had so many features I have not even touched on this page.
</p>

<p>
  However, it was not optimized for a broad player base, and due to its
  complexity, its accessibility was not as good as in my other minigames
  (EarthGames and ZombieV).
</p>

<p>
  Because the other games were just more popular and more fun to work with (and,
  admittedly, the codebase of the War game was not very good), after some time,
  I just stopped working on it and spent my time improving the other minigames.
  When we finally joined the Snapcraft network from the Netherlands, I did not
  port the War game to their server and instead brought EarthGames and ZombieV
  with me.
</p>

<p>This was the end of the (really fun) minigame.</p>
