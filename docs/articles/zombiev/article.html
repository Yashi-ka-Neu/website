<h2>ZombieV</h2>

<p>
  ZombieV is a Minecraft Minigame that I have invented, developed, and published
  to thousands of players via the Snapcraft gaming network from the Netherlands.
  It is written in Java. The concept is simple: players fight together against
  pre-defined waves of crazy enemies. By killing those enemies, they get money,
  which they can invest in stronger armor, weapons, and some other special
  perks. Besides a lot of crazy fun elements (items like grenades, an
  interactive map which, for example, changes over the course of the game, and
  boss waves), players could also use the equipment they unlocked to challenge
  other players in a 1v1 fight.

<p>
  Around 2012, I was playing the game Minecraft and running my own minigames
  server. I honestly do not remember how I got the idea, but I decided to
  develop the "ZombieSurvival" minigame by coding a Java plugin with that
  functionality. The features were: there are hardcoded enemy waves (e.g. wave 1
  is 10 zombies with certain health spawned at certain locations, wave 2 is 4
  endermen with a lot of health and special damage, etc.). Players can join the
  arena at any time. If the arena is currently empty, it will start with wave 1.
  Otherwise, the players just join at the current wave. They get money by
  killing enemies themselves (plus some money for kills of a nearby player),
  which they can invest in new equipment. This equipment and its cost was also
  hardcoded and defined by me. If the players survive all waves and kill the
  final boss (last wave) they get a lot of money as a reward. Starting out with
  a really bad map, limited waves, and really bad code, the minigame evolved
  over time.
</p>

<p>
  I kept adding new waves and features every day. Eventually, I met the Swedish
  gentleman David and merged my minigames server (custom plugins) with his
  server (bigger player base). We created the network named "Zeuby" and had
  around 40-90 players online at once at this point. The new ZombieSurvival map,
  which I built, looked like the following:

<p>
  I became more and more ambitious and started adding new features such as
  artificial players (NPCs) as enemies, which behaved and moved like regular
  players, using pathfinding algorithms and some logic to turn them into
  autonomous entities.

<p>
  Many other features were implemented, such as the possibility to purchase a
  wolf, which follows the player within the arena. The player can upgrade the
  health, damage, and other attributes of the wolf and select one of many
  different special abilities, which could also be upgraded (e.g., the wolf can
  shoot fireballs), and also ride on the wolf while fighting. Players could also
  select one of multiple different super weapons (e.g. bow with explosive ammo,
  a sword that can shoot fireballs, an axe with extreme attack). They could give
  their weapon a name and enhance it in the so-called Forge.

<h3>Rollout on Snapcraft</h3>

<p>
  Due to different reasons (described in more detail in the EarthGames article),
  I joined the gaming network Snapcraft, owned by Bas and Maarten from the
  Netherlands. There, I became Developer, Administrator, and Partner of
  Snapcraft after some time. With the useful feedback of Bas and Maarten, I
  improved the player experience of the game a lot.
</p>

<p>
  In the beginning, ZombieSurvival shared its server with the minigame
  EarthGames, but we quickly concluded that it would make sense to move
  ZombieSurvival to its own server due to the high player count. As we had
  anticipated a lot of ZombieSurvival changes and the original codebase was not
  that good, I decided to rewrite ZombieSurvival from scratch. Now, with the new
  code, multiple arenas were supported, and I realized other crazy ideas, such
  as sound effects, fireworks (e.g. when a wave is defeated), a new shop, crazy
  waves (such as many enemies stacked up on top of each other), and an
  interactive map (e.g. a solid tower that moves and can shoot arrows).

<p>
  Then, finally, ZombieSurvival was released on its own server in 2013, being
  called ZombieV now. It was accepted by the players quickly and ran quite
  successfully.

<p>
  As more and more players joined, we added new arenas and I implemented more
  features.

<h3>How the story continued</h3>

<p>
  Having achieved my goals and successfully completed my minigames, as well as
  enjoyed a large player base, I lost interest in the game Minecraft and
  eventually stopped playing it. I continued to update my minigames until
  competent maintainers were found, and I must say that they have done a great
  job. As Snapcraft kept evolving, so did ZombieV. Nowadays, it looks very
  different and even more sophisticated:

<h3>A quick overview of the 1v1 fights</h3>

<p>
  Players could challenge each other to a 1v1 fight on the ZombieV server. In
  that fight, they can use all the equipment, which they collect during playing
  ZombieSurvival.
