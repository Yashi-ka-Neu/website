  BossShopProEditor is a web application that makes it easier to configure shops
  of the BossShopPro Java plugin. It is written in TypeScript and uses VueJs.
  Before I have written this web application (together with a good friend of
  mine), I had created a desktop application in Java, which served the same
  purpose (<a
    href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bossshopproconfigure-configuration-and-setup-tool.28791/"
    >Link</a
  >) and there was an even older tool before that.
</p>

<br />

<h2>History</h2>

<br />

<p>
  Already in 2012, I started developing Java plugins for the computer game
  "Minecraft". Those plugins could be deployed by the administrators of a
  "Minecraft server", where they would then affect the gameplay of the server,
  and, ideally, enhance the gameplay for the players of this server.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Not being into the game, one might severely underestimate the size and impact
  of those servers. In reality, there are over 100 million people playing the
  game Minecraft. And while anyone can easily set up a server and allow other
  players to join, the huge player-base led to professional companies and
  entrepreneurs making big business out of it. Due to the possibility of such
  server plugins, one can customize their server to a crazy extent and also
  charge players real-world money for certain permissions or premium features on
  their server. That way, many servers became commercialized and interested in
  high-quality plugins that provide their server a unique experience for their
  players.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  I, personally, at that time, was just one of many players playing Minecraft
  just for the sake of having fun. I was developing plugins, mainly, for my own
  server, but also sharing them publicly, because I liked the positive attention
  I was getting from other server owners and because I felt it would be valuable
  to learn how to code. One of those plugins I developed and publicly shared was
  BossShop(Pro). While BossShop(Pro) was and still is very powerful, it also is
  complex and, especially for beginners, can be complicated to work with: it
  provides tons of options for server administrators to set certain things up,
  using a configuration YAML file. Therefore, people should have some
  familiarity with config files in general, and also take some time to learn how
  the BossShop(Pro) configs are supposed to look like.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  An extensive
  <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bossshoppro/">Wiki page</a> with an
  <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bossshoppro/">introduction</a>,
  <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bossshoppro-examples/">examples</a>,
  and a
  <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bossshoppro-faq-and-help/">FAQ page</a>
  help people learn how to configure the plugin.
</p>

<br />

<h3>BossShopConfigure</h3>

<br />

<p>
  Yet, I still wanted to make the life of the users of my plugin easier, and
  actually also my own life. Realizing that an extensive graphical user
  interface would be way more intuitive than some plain configuration text file,
  I decided to develop exactly that. Additionally, this GUI can have the option
  to auto-complete choices of the user, as well as list the different options
  one has for a certain config setting.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  The resulting GUI tool is shown in the following video. I named it
  <a
    href="https://bukkit.org/threads/gui-admin-bossshopconfigure-shop-config-editor.222404/"
    >BossShopConfigure</a
  >.

<br />

<h3>BossShopConfigureX</h3>

<br />

<p>
  BossShopConfigure was alright, but it was missing some features that I wanted,
  such as advanced help menus, auto-completion of material names and other enum
  values, and some more. Therefore, I decided to develop something much more
  sophisticated and advanced than BossShopConfigure. The result was
  <a
    href="https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/bossshop-gui-configuration-setup-tool.150313/"
    >BossShopConfigureX</a
  >.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  The most distinct change of the new tool was, that it would require and use a
  "Minecraft server jar file" provided by the user of the tool. The tool would
  then hook into the API of this server jar file and retrieve a lot of
  information from there, such as a list of available material names,
  enchantments, potion types, and more. Therefore, whenever new content would be
  added to Minecraft, instead of the tool needing to be updated to include the
  new content, the tool would, automatically, always be up-to-date with whatever
  server version the user of the tool would provide.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  This is the kind of robustness and independence I want my software to have:
  not having to update it, whenever somewhere else something is changed.

<br />

<p>
  Note that after some time of maintaining BossShopConfigureX, I released the
  premium version of my plugin, called BossShopPro. For that premium version, I
  also provided a slightly adjusted version of BossShopConfigureX, which I
  called
  <a
    href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bossshopproconfigure-configuration-and-setup-tool.28791/"
    >BossShopProConfigure</a
  >.
</p>

<br />

<h3>BossShopProEditor</h3>

<br />

<p>
  This tool was quite successful and well-received, but I still felt that it
  might be a little confusing for new users of my plugin, plus the number of
  options the tool provides (e.g., complexity) might overwhelm the user. Also,
  the design of the tool was quite ugly. It just happened that during an
  internship in 2019, I learned to code web applications in TypeScript and got
  familiar with the VueJs framework. Additionally, using BossShopProConfigure
  myself, I realized that, while it makes a lot of things easier, it also lacks
  some possibilities in comparison to a raw configuration file.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  True, the tool shows you everything you can do, but still, you have to spend
  quite some time clicking the different buttons in the GUI. Everything is
  possible but speed is limited. When editing a raw configuration file, on the
  other hand, users, probably, do not know every option they have/every feature
  the plugin has, but they can be quite fast if they know what to do. Create a
  new shop entry? Copy and paste. Copy some item definition to somewhere else?
  Copy and paste. One can simply be a lot faster with the raw configuration
  file.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Seeing the pros and cons of both concepts, I decided that the ideal
  configuration tool would be one that merges both worlds. The idea of
  <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bossshoppro-editor.64777/"
    >BossShopProEditor</a
  >
  was born. During my internship, I was collaborating a lot with a colleague and
  friend of mine, who is extremely good at web development, and I liked working
  with him a lot. It felt very productive and creative. Therefore, I proposed to
  him to develop BossShopProEditor as a joint project. He would focus on the
  VueJs components in the 'GUI' half of the application, and I would focus on
  the configuration half of the application and about linking both components
  together. This is exactly what we did, resulting in a quite intuitive and
  powerful, yet surprisingly simple application.

<h3>Honorable mentions</h3>

<br />

<p>
  Besides my own tooling efforts for BossShop(Pro), there are some more tools
  out there, which other developers have created. For example, on the
  <a href="https://www.mc-market.org/search/35630/?q=BossShop&o=relevance"
    >mc-market.org website</a
  >, there are developers selling their own configurator, as well as people
  selling their service of configuring shops, as well as pre-configured shops.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Additionally, on Spigot, other users provide tools that make setting up shops
  easier, such as this one:
  <a
    href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/gui-creation-tool-make-gui-crate-shop-formats-in-game-in-seconds.51660/"
    >Link</a
  >.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Last but not least, my BossShopPro addon
  <a
    href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/itemshops-bsp-create-fancy-gui-shops-with-minimal-effort.26640/"
    >"BSP ItemShops"</a
  >
  makes setting up very standard shops where only regular items are sold very
  easy.
