  EarthGames is a Minecraft Minigame that I have invented, developed, and
  published to thousands of players via the Snapcraft gaming network from the
  Netherlands. At its peak, different Youtubers, who now have over 50 Million
  subscribers combined, have played and enjoyed EarthGames.

<h2>History</h2>

<br />

<h3>First steps</h3>

<br />

<p>
  Around 2011, a friend of mine and me were playing the game Minecraft and had a
  fun fight. I attacked him, but he then started to dig down in the dirt, trying
  to hide. I followed him and a battle within the earth started (under the
  ground). Because the fight was extremely fun, a few days later, I created a
  dirt-arena for us to play. This was the beginning of EarthGames.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  The arena supported four players only and would work like the following: When
  all four players are ready, the game master writes "Go" in the chat. Then all
  players jump in the start-boxes of their color and equip themselves with
  torches, weapons, and spades, which can be found at their starting location.
  Then the fight starts: players dig, hide, and fight.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  A year later, I founded the so-called "WarGames" server, which contained
  combat minigames I wrote. I somehow remembered the old "EarthGame" (as it was
  called at that time) and started coding a plugin for it, adding new features
  every day. At that time there was just one single map and never more than 35
  players at once.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  The game assigned the players to one of the two teams (red or blue) and gave
  them a corresponding name color, as well as head color, making it easier to
  recognize teammates. Both teams have a distinct spawn location (where players
  get respawned if they get killed) and try to collect as many kills as
  possible, to achieve victory.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Additionally, players could collect kills and buy fancy perks with those
  kills. That includes stronger armor, better swords, a better spade, and even
  explosives: grenades that could be thrown (normally not a part of Minecraft,
  but I just used Minecraft API to spawn a snowball when the "grenade item" is
  clicked, which then generates an explosion when it hits something), and
  dynamite that could be placed and would detonate after a few seconds.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Those special items could be bought only from a few special "chest shops" that
  were located in very central places of the map. These were the places the
  players tried to conquer and where most fights were going on. A few additional
  features, such as a private chat for team members, improved the whole
  experience.

<p>
  Later I have connected my own server (Neuby War) with the server of the
  Swedish gentleman David, with whom I got in touch because of different coding
  discussions (I taught him programming in Java, at least as much as I could
  with my own little experience at that time). Running the server for a few
  months, we came to a point, where our player count did not improve a lot and
  we both were rather tired from the work we put into the servers every single
  day.
</p>

<br />

<h3>Rollout on Snapcraft</h3>

<br />

<p>
  Therefore, I contacted Bas and Maarten, the owners of the awesome gaming
  network "Snapcraft", from the Netherlands. They already had a huge player base
  at that point (over 1000 Players online at once) and I joined them with my
  custom written Minigames. I also brought David along, who got a Staff position
  on Snapcraft too.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Together with the useful feedback of Bas and Maarten, I adopted the plugins
  and improved the Minigame experience by many different tweaks (such as just
  calling the currency "Money" instead of WarPoints). They built new, really
  gorgeous maps for the minigames and after just a few weeks, we put the
  minigames online, for their player base. The feedback was astonishing and a
  huge amount of players played the minigame. It was a truly fascinating
  experience.

<br />

<p>
  Because the number of players was so big, in fact, after just a few days, we
  decided to create multiple arenas instead of just one. Also, every arena would
  get its own dedicated "Minecraft Server", instead of all being on one server.
  This way we would solve lag and delays that were caused by the vast amount of
  players. This was planned and executed within around one week, which was
  important to keep the player experience good and not to annoy players with
  slow response times of the servers.
</p>

<br />

<p>Oh, and some big Youtubers were invited and played the game :)</p>

<p>
  In August 2013 I stopped playing the game Minecraft, but, of course, Snapcraft
  does keep the minigames and now pays other developers to update and maintain
  the plugins.
