<p>
  ManaWars is a sidescrolling game written in Java. Starting out as a simple
  computer game, it has evolved over time and later became an Android game with
  a custom game engine and eventually a cross-platform game using the existing
  game engine <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libGDX</a>.
</p>

<br />

<h2>Development Progress</h2>

<br />

<h3>ManaWars for Desktop</h3>

<p>
  Having written the simple Desktop game ManaWar, I wanted to continue with
  developing my own game, but this time a little bit different. Taking my
  experience from the development of Minecraft Minigame ZombieV, I wanted a game
  where the player fights against predefined waves of enemies and can upgrade
  his abilities over time (e.g., better attacks or more health).
</p>

<br />

<p>
  As in the development of ManaWar, my brother supported my game development and
  code by drawing the characters and other artwork for the game. As the creation
  of the character animations in ManaWar was too much effort (my brother drew
  every single character animation frame by hand), we decided to go with my
  brother drawing static skin files and me writing code that automatically
  aligns the body parts of the skin file in the proper way to simulate character
  movement/animations. Therefore, I wrote multiple tools supporting the drawing
  efforts of my brother.

<br />

<p>
  After some time, I designed the gameplay: a player has health, mana, and a
  certain walk speed, which can be upgraded. Mana regenerates over time and is
  used to cast so-called "skills." Every player has 3 skills (and enemies have 1
  to 3 skills) selected at a time. Examples of skills include fireballs or
  arrows. The stronger a skill is, the more mana it costs to use it.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  The game featured a few different modes. For example, in the Sidescroller
  mode, the player walks to the right and meets predefined enemy tribes on the
  way. In order to reach the next "stage" (e.g., next batch of enemies/next
  tribe), the previous tribe has to be defeated. At the end of every tribe, the
  player meets a boss he has to kill. Another mode was "Waves," where the player
  has a fixed area to move within and is challenged by enemies appearing from
  the left and right. When one wave of enemies is killed, the next wave will
  appear.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Every game mode can be played either alone or with up to 3 friends, using the
  same computer locally. The resulting game was quite nice already.

<h3>ManaWars for Android</h3>

<p>
  Realizing that the kind of gameplay we created is suited for mobile devices, I
  decided to port the game to Android. I put a lot of time into coding the game
  and thinking about ideas to enhance the gameplay even more, while my brother
  put a lot of time into the artwork. The results were really great.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Also, I added multiple different game modes to spice things up. Now, we would
  have one big world map, where the player would select "missions" (inspired by
  the game Castle Crashers, as well as the game Legendary Wars). Some missions
  would be typical "Wave" or "Stage" missions (see ManaWars for PC), but some
  would also be platformer missions, where one must avoid falling from the
  platform while fighting enemies and reaching the end of the map. There would
  also be "CastleDefense" missions, where the player owns a castle and summons
  units that attack the enemies and the enemyâ€™s castle.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  As done in my other games, the player could upgrade most things available in
  the game: character stats (health, mana, speed), skills, a buddy that follows
  the player, and even the castle. The player could also upgrade and exchange
  the units available for the castle.

<p>
  The creation of new content, such as levels, was accelerated by self-written
  tools, such as a campaign map editor.

<h3>ManaWars Crystalseeker (Cross-platform)</h3>

<p>
  We were quite satisfied with most parts of the Android game; however, there
  was one major drawback: although not very big, the game was rather slow. The
  performance was disappointing. At that time, I had almost no clue about memory
  allocation on Android, and since the game engine was completely custom
  written, it was far from being performance-optimized. Having successfully
  written my own (although not very fast or flexible) game engine, I accepted
  that I had learned enough and it was time to move to an already existing, more
  sophisticated game engine. I chose
  <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libGDX</a> and ported our game to
  libGDX. Doing that, I rewrote and improved many parts of the code.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  ManaWars CrystalSeeker was born, our very first cross-platform game. The
  engine would enable us to port the game to Android, iOS, PC, HTML5, and more.

<h3>ManaWars (new cross-platform version)</h3>

<p>
  Having learned a lot more about software architecture and wanting to try out
  the language Kotlin, I decided to rewrite most parts of ManaWars CrystalSeeker
  in Kotlin and improve some parts of the architecture at the same time. A new
  version of ManaWars was created, which was more user-friendly than the
  previous versions and is a complete game, including a final endboss.
